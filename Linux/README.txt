Note that files were changed from prior version, from CRLF to LF ending to be compatible with Linux. 
This can sometimes be changed by programs or systems to interfere. If command is found but doesn't run, check status of CRLF vs LF. You can change this for instance in VS Code in the bottom right of the GUI.
