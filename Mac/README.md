Simply put files in directory accessed as part of "Path" environmental variable, and make sure they are executables per permission (if that's how it works on macs). I know Windows and Linux and two out of three ain't bad. 

Note, these files are currently untested. Safe, just untested on a Mac. 

Not sure also if Mac struggles with CRLF as does Linux, but these files should have CRLF stripped and replaced with LF. 

Google if curious and/or think could be an issue. Sometimes they automatically get changed.
